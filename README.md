# vscode-vim-settings
My personal setup for a good mixture of vim and vs code hotkeys.

The standard vim extension is blocking too many vs code hot keys for me, e.g `ctrl + k` cannot open the file finder anymore.  

Vim settings, like vim.normalModeKeyBindingsNonRecursive, can only be set set in the user settings of vs code. 

Those can be found under: </br>
	-	Windows: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json` </br>
	-	macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json` </br>
	-	Linux: `$HOME/.config/Code/User/settings.json` </br>
